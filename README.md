# ChutePinterest
Pinterest Style Page using Chute API.

This is a Pinterest style page that displays the pics loaded from the Chute API (http://www.getchute.com/developers/reference/).
I developed this page as a part of a programming challenge using AngularJS as my chosen front-end framework. 
I used grid style libraries and also incorporated a "More" button to implement infinte scrolling.

Just putting here to show my dabbling skills and learn a new language :) <br>
Feel free to shoot me questions on how I made it.<br>
Cheers
